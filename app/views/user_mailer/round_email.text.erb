Recordstage Voting Starts Now!
Hello Recordstage user, voting for all four genres starts today. New rounds will start every Sunday and Wednesday, so be sure to check in often.



Please Share!
Recordstage only works if it has enough users submitting music and voting on songs.
Please share Recordstage with any friends or communities you're a part of, it would be greatly appreciated!



Site Updates
The follower limit will be lowered from 75,000 to 25,000.
Hip Hop had 25 entrants. Nine byes will be randomly handed out so the bracket can progress normally.
A bugfix around fonts not loading in should be out soon.



Feedback
Will there be more genres added? 
While I agree that more genres would be great, my concern is that (like Pop) there won't be enough participation for some more niche genres.
If the site gains more traction and more users join, I will definitely be able to open up more genres!

Shouldn't the follower limit be even lower?
To me, this is another case of being concerned about participation, will there be enough submissions if the pool of eligible artists is smaller?
However, if users are primarily artists submitting their own music, I agree that it should be lowered to 10k or even lower.

Any other feedback or questions?
Please use the contact link on your profile or tweet at @Recordstage on Twitter.



You can turn off these emails in your profile. I plan on adding an email preference for announcements in addition to the one on rounds starting. This email is sort of a combination of both, but they'll be separate going forward.
